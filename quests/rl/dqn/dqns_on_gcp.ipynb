It's a service that sets up scaling distributed training so data scientists and machine learning engineers do not have to worry about technical infrastructure. Usually, it automatically selects the [container environment](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list), but we're going to take advantage of a feature to specify our own environment with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). Not only will this allow us to install our game environment to be deployed to the cloud, but it will also significantly speed up hyperparameter tuning time as each worker can skip the library installation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"Dockerfile\">Dockerfile</a> in this directory shows the steps taken to build this environment. First, we copy from a [Google Deep Learning Container](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/deep-learning-containers/docs/choosing-container) which already has Google Cloud Libraries installed. Then, we install our other desired modules and libraries. `ffmpeg`, `xvfb`, and `python-opengl` are needed in order to get video output from the server. Machines on the cloud don't typically have a display (why would they need one?), so we'll make a virtual display of our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we copy our code, we tell the container to be configured as an executable so we can pass our hyperparameter tuning flags to it with the [ENTRYPOINT](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21553353/what-is-the-difference-between-cmd-and-entrypoint-in-a-dockerfile) command. In order to set up our virtual display, we can use the [xvfb-run](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xvfb-run.1.html) command. Unfortunately, Docker strips quotes from specified commands in ENTRYPOINT, so we'll make a super simple shell script, <a href=\"train_model.sh\">train_model.sh</a>, to specify our virtual display parameters. The `\"@\"` parameter is used to pass the flags called against the container to our python module, `trainer.trainer`.\n",

    "## The Theory Behind Deep Q Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental principle behind RL is we have two entities: the **agent** and the **environment**. The agent takes state and reward information about the envionment and chooses an action. The environment takes that action and will change to be in a new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/agent_and_environment.jpg\" width=\"476\" height=\"260\">\n",
    "\n",
    "RL assumes that the environment follows a [Markov Decision Process (MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). That means the state is dependent partially on the agent's actions, and partially on chance. MDPs can be represented by a graph, with states and actions as nodes, and rewards and path probabilities on the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/mdp.jpg\" width=\"471\" height=\"243\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So what would be the best path through the graph above? Or perhaps a more difficult question, what would be our expected winnings if we played optimally? The probability introduced in this problem has inspired multiple strategies over the years, but all of them boil down to the idea of discounted future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you rather have `$100` now or `$105` a year from now? With inflation, there's no definitive answer, but each of us has a threshold that we use to determine the value of something now versus the value of something later. In psychology, this is called [Delayed Gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification). Richard E. Bellman expressed this theory in an equation widely used in RL called the [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation). Let's introduce some vocab to better define it.\n",

This is where neural networks save the day! Rather than categorize each state, we can feed state properties into our network. By having the same number of output nodes as possible actions, our network can be used to predict the value of the next state given the current state and action.\n",
