    "| Full | -1 | -.5 | 1.5 |\n",

    "Instead for Policy Gradients, we can imagine that we have a similar table, but instead of recording the values, we'll keep track of the probability to take the column action given the row state.\n",

    "\n",

    "We've added a new tool called [entropy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01557.pdf). We're calculating the [log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Log-likelihood) again, but instead of comparing the probabilities of our actions versus the action that was taken, we calculating it for the probabilities of our actions against themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly a mouthful, but the idea is to encourage exploration: if our probability prediction is very confident (or close to 1), our entropy will be close to 0. Similary, if our probability isn't confident at all (or close to 0), our entropy will again be zero. Anywhere inbetween, our entropy will be non-zero. This encourages exploration versus exploitation, as the entropy will discourage overconfident predictions.\n",

Once there are enough experiences in the buffer, we'll use all the experiences to train and then clear the buffer to start fresh.\n",
